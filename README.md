# UFOs
## Overview
This analysis was performed to better help Dana showcase the different UFO sightings based on the location and shape. This was done using JavaScript and HTML so that Dana could view her results on a webpage.
## Results
Using the new search criteria Dana has access to locational data on each sighting and can filter the results based upon what country, state or city the UFO was sighted in. Furthermore Dana has the ability to filter based upon the shape of the UFO as well.
## Summary
The one drawback of the new webpage design is that it doesn't look as clean and streamlined. We could spruce it up with a little more CSS work to make the data more easily read. Further we could use the search bar to include similar results to each sighting.
